        <h2>My Past</h2>
        <p> Growing up in Zimbabwe is not without its struggles whether itâ€™s the constant challenge of economic hardships, limited resources at school, or the uncertainty of the future. Every day I remind myself that education is the key to breaking the cycle and building a better tomorrow. Even when books are scarce or power cuts make it hard to study, I push forward, because I know perseverance will open doors. I carry the hope that through hard work and resilience, I will succeed in school and one day uplift not only myself, but my family and community as well. </p>

        <p>Facing the task of providing for his siblings in Harare, Tinashe persevered by collecting discarded vegetables from the market. He cleaned and bundled them, selling them from a small cart. His determination made this humble effort into an amazing business, proving that trying hard can build a future from nothing.</p>
